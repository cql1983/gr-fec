gr-fec GNUradio package contain Viterbi decoder's for weather satellite telemetry decoding
 
-- fec_decode_viterbi_ahrpt_metop_cb
It is rate 3/4 decoder with depuncturing
for MetOp AHRPT satellite telemetry decoding

-- fec_decode_viterbi_ahrpt_fengyun_cb
It is rate 3/4 decoder with depuncturing
for Fengyun3 AHRPT satellite telemetry decoding

-- fec_decode_viterbi_bpsk_fb
It is rate 1/2 decoder with no depuncturing
       for GOES LRIT telemetry decoding
       
       
It contain also simple convolutional encoder
-- fec_encode_convolutional_27_bb
It is 1/2 encoder for real data for transmition or for test purpose of decoders


This package requires that gnuradio-core is already installed and viterbi.c + viterbi.h
file in Viterbi folder for new replaced. 



It also depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as Boost and
cppunit.


To build and install use these commands:
  
  .. cd to gr-fec directory and do next steps
  
  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install
  $ ldconfig
